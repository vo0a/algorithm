## 183. Customers Who Never Order

> Easy

[문제](https://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-never-order/)



### left join

```sql
select name as Customers
from (
    select name, customerid
    from Customers left join Orders on Customers.id = Orders.CustomerId
) as talbe
where customerid is null;
```

- Orders 테이블의 CustomerId가 없는 Customers 테이블의 Name을 출력하는 문제이다.
- 이 방법이 제일 빨랐다.



### not in

```sql
-- 방법 1
select name as Customers
from customers s 
where id not in (select customerid from orders)

-- 방법 2
with a as
(select customerid from orders)

select Name as Customers
from customers s 
where id not in (select * from a)
```
